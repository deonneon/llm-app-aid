## Overview

LLM App Aid is a web application designed to streamline the process of managing and navigating through the file structure of a project. It enables users to view, select, and fetch content from files within a specified directory dynamically. The application is built with React, Next.js, and leverages Tailwind CSS for styling.

This app includes functionality to:

- Dynamically load and display the file tree of a project.
- Fetch file content from the server using Next.js API routes.
- Allow users to select specific files to concatenate their contents for display.
- Enable adding custom text to the concatenated content.
- Copy the concatenated content to the clipboard.

The app architecture is organized as follows:

- `app/` directory contains global styles, layout, and page components.
- `components/` directory houses the `FileTree.js` component responsible for rendering the file tree and managing state.
- `pages/api` directory includes Next.js API routes for fetching file and directory contents.
- `public/` serves static files like images or icons.
